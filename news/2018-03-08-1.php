      In addition to the usual regular snapshots, the current master builds deliver binaries with 
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Vector_Extensions">AVX (Advanced Vector Extensions)</a> support.
      AVX is an instruction set available in many modern CPUs. The internal PHP implementation uses these
      specific CPU instructions to improve performance.
    </p>

    <p>Processors, manufactured after 2011, most likely support AVX. The exact information about the
    hardware can be retrieved by using the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/coreinfo">Coreinfo</a> tool.</p>

    <p>Help us to test these new flavours, any feedback appreciated!</p>
