  <?php news_date('21-Aug-2019') ?>

    <p>
      We used Visual Studio 2019 to build the early releases of PHP 7.4 (up to
      and including 7.4.0beta2), and although Visual Studio 2019 is generally an
      improvement over Visual Studio 2017, but due to compatibility issues we
      have decided to switch back to Visual Studio 2017 for our PHP 7.4 builds,
      and we are planning to stick with this for the complete lifetime of PHP
      7.4.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our master snapshots are still built with Visual Studio 2019, and we are
      planning to stick with Visual Studio 2019 for PHP 8.0.
