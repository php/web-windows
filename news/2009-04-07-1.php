  <div>
    <p>The PHP Development Team would like to
    announce the availability of a new Windows
    build for PHP - PHP 5.2.9-2</p>

    <p>This release focuses on fixing security
    flaws in the included OpenSSL library
    (CVE-2009-0590, CVE-2009-0591 and
    CVE-2009-0789). The security advisory is
    available <a href=
    "http://openssl.org/news/secadv_20090325.txt">
    here</a>.</p>

    <p>The OpenSSL library has been updated to
    0.9.8k, which includes fixes for these
    flaws.</p>

    <p>Note: Only the Windows binaries are
    affected. There are no changes to the PHP
    sources, therefore no source releases are
    necessary.</p>

    <p>Binaries are available in our <a href=
    "/download/">downloads page</a></p>
